# practicing-gba-programming
A repository that I use to store and showcase finished and unfinished ideas and projects I build for the GBA in ARM.

**Note: unless a proper header is added, these programs will not work on real hardware (nor some emulators).**
I do not include the header in order to avoid copyright infringement, as it includes a bitmap of the Nintendo logo.

## Build Instructions

Assemble a program with the [Goldroad 1.7](https://www.gbadev.org/tools.php?showinfo=192) assembler:

```
